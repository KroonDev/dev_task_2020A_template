```javascript
// Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**3. Can you translate your refactored function to Javascript equivalent code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**4. Can you write unit tests and stress tests for your translated Javascript code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript unit test goes here
```
```javascript
// Your Javascript stress test goes here
```
